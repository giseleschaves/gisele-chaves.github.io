            <span class="question">1 - Were blocked on a simple problem</span>
            <p>
              When I was coding the Tic-tac-toe game I had a problem to
              manipulate the board positions using DOM API methods.
            </p>
            <p>
              What was the problem?
              <br />
              There are many methods to seletct elements and manipulae them
              using Java Script. It's necessary to pay attention which data type
              each method return. Some of them return only one element, other
              return more a group of elements using different data types.
              <br />
              <ul class="answer-list">
                <li>querySelectorAll()</li>
                <li>querySelector()</li>
                <li>getElementByID()</li>
                <li>getElementByClassName()</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              I was using wrong Javacript methods to interact with the elements and having error messages. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Google the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document" target="_blank" >DOM API Reference </a> and read each method and examples how to use them.

            <span class="question">how did you feel throughout the process?</span>
            <p>I decided to test separadly test each method to understand the return and the right wayt to interact with the elements.</p>
            <br>
            <span class="question">What did you learn?</span> 
            <p>It's better to understand first which is the right method use before adding them to the code. I spend a long time until undertand the problem was just this</p>

            <span class="question">3 - Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:?</span>
            <ul class="answer-list">
              <li>Pseudocode - I often write the steps about what I wanto to buid, not as a Pseudocode but like a checklist what I need to do </li>
              <li>Trying something</li>
              <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
              <li>Reading error messages - I always read the error message and which line is the problem. Not alwwys they explain the problem but make much easy to find where to start to debbug back.</li>
              <li>Console.logging - I always us, it's the favorite one</li>
              <li>Googling - I like to google but looking for reference sites like <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3 Schools</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank" >MDN Document </a>. I use <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank" >Stack Overflow </a> only when it's a more difficul case. I had to use it, time ago to fix some package issues.</li>
              <li>Asking your peers for help - I've never use it in this course, but I like to used in another one</li>
              <li>Asking coaches for help - I often don't ask for help, only when I want to understand more about some concepts and get tips to practice something. However this week Lucy insisted to help me and save my day. :-)</li>
              <li>Improving your process with reflection - I like to review my code to identify ways to implement things with different solutions or optimize something.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <span class="question"> 4 - Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?</span>
            <p>
              The last few days I was reluctant, but my main blocker was the doubt about if I should spend more time learning Java Script or not to progress to the bootcamp.
              I had a good conversation with Joseph about the course and my question and this helped me a lot. I was close to give up.
              Lucy also helped me a lot.
