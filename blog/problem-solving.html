            <span class="question">1 - Were blocked on a simple problem</span>
            <p>
              When I was coding the Tic-tac-toe game I had a problem to
              manipulate the board positions using DOM API methods.
            </p>
            <p>
              What was the problem?
              <br />
              There are many methods to seletct elements and manipulae them
              using Java Script. It's necessary to pay attention which data type
              each method return. Some of them return only one element, other
              return more a group of elements using different data types.
              <br />
              <ul class="answer-list">
                <li>querySelectorAll()</li>
                <li>querySelector()</li>
                <li>getElementByID()</li>
                <li>getElementByClassName()</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              I was using wrong Javacript methods to interact with the elements and having error messages. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Google the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document" target="_blank" >DOM API Reference </a> and read each method and examples how to use them.

            <span class="question">how did you feel throughout the process?</span>
            <p>I decided to test separadly test each method to understand the return and the right wayt to interact with the elements.</p>
            <br>
            <span class="question">What did you learn?</span> 
            <p>It's better to understand first which is the right method use before adding them to the code. I spend a long time until undertand the problem was just this</p>
