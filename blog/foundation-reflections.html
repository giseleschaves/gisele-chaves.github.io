            <span class="question"
              >What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in
              learning and programming?</span
            >
            <p>
              I compare the learning process of programming to the process of learning a new language. It requires being aware of ourselves because it's a long journey with frustration, self-doubt and challenging moments. It's common to have negative thoughts, and question if one day we can consider ourselves professionals. Even though we can become professionals, a developer is always to be in the learning mode. Of course, in any career, we need to keep ourselves updated, but working with technology requires more.

            >What were the most challenging aspects of the core
            learning?</span
          >
            <p>
              The topics are really important, especially to reflect on our weaknesses and dealing with frustration. I need to change my routine and pay attention to moments of self-awareness and reflection to fight against my anxiety. However, I have to confess the way to work with these topics didn't work for me. I don't like to expose myself and also it's a content a bit boring to read. I would like to learn and practice them using other activities.
            </p>
            
            <span class="question"
              >Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much
              time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp
              course?</span
            >
            <p>
              Because of the difficulties that learning programming brings to the students. I know how it can be challenging and make people think they're stupid and suffer from impostor syndrome. I see the value, but I would like to spend time with this in another way. Exposing this in the blog didn't help me. I hope that during the Bootcamp we can work on this in another way.
            </p>
            <span
              >Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a
              waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise
              programming instead? Justify your answer.</span
            >
            <p>I need to confess that I would like to spend more time learning tech skills, but again it's more due to the way that we had to work on the core material. Also, the mix of this content with the technical part, makes me to skip this part which is necessary to the course. I had to complete the pages with lorem ipsum to feel more comfortable and complete the blog structure.</p>
