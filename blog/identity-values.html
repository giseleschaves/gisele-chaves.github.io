              Years ago I was working as tech lead in a company, and one of my
              coworkers asked for a salary raising. She was an awesome recourse
              but I didn't have ownership to decide it, so I pass it thorught
              the manager.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unfortunately the company didn't have budget to raise her salary
              and I had to give her this answer. She of course was dissapointed
              and weeks later she resign, saying that she found another job and
              ask only for one week of notice. We were under a lot of pression
              due to a project, but it's the risk the company decided to take.
              We found another person and everyhting looked great.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the last day of her work, she decided to talk directly with the
              manager saying that she regret and didn't want to leave the job.
              The manager decided to ask me to join the meeting to know my
              opinion in the case. I had to explain to her that was really sad,
              but we couldn't leave the other person who also was in his notice
              period. It was not fair with him.
            </p>
            <p>
              What makes this situation much more complex is, she was my best
              friend. We met each other there and she told me that she didn't
              have any other offer. But asked me to keep this as secrect.
              Despite my many advices to her for not doing this, ask for leaving
              laying about a new offer. She decided this was the only way to
              have a salary raising. I had a really difficult decision, and
              unfortunatelly she never forgive me. :-(

            <span class="question">
              2 - Describe how your culture and the people around you have
              influenced your values and identity.</span
            >
            <p>
              I grow up in Brazil and our work culture is really different then
              in New Zealand. The two main differences the concept abot work
              life balance and feedbak.
            </p>
            <ul class="answer-list">
              <li>
                Work life balance - In my culture the social inequality makes
                people have the work as the most important thing in their life.
                Because of this, it's expected to work much more hours and
                sacrifyce your personal life.
              </li>
              <li>
                Feedback - It's not commom to give a honest and direct feedback
                in my culture. People often take things too personal or don't
                give constructive feedback to develop and growth others.
              </li>
              <p>
                Working as a manager I always try to work in these values. I had
                a manager from German who helped me a lot to understand feedback

                I'm resilient person and fast leaner. My decision to move to New
                Zealand after having a sucessfull carrear in Brazil tested my
                strengths. The first years were not easy. Learning a new
                language require practice and dedication, which I compare with
                coding. I had to deal with frustation and uncertanty that an
                immigrant often has, but this period build my muscles to the
                worst.
              </p>
              <p>
                I consider myself a fast learner beacuse of my focus and
                experience with previous courses and challenges.

                I started to have in the last 6 years some anxiety crises. I can
                recognized now that I'm always a anxious child but I could
                manage it. I was a really good student, and not trouble child,
                so I did'nt have much more problems to manage. Before moving to
                New Zealand, I used to do sports which helped me a lot to
                control these moments. However I totally stopped to do exercises
                in the past years which deteriorate a lot my situation and the
                way that I deal with these crises.

                During my pos-graduate period, I had some difficult to do the
                first work group. I remember that I was the only women in the
                group and the other 3 men from other cultures. They didn't
                listen my ideas during our first meeting. After a time I
                realized that it could be a cultural problem, and try to acces
                them in another way. Instead keep fighting to make them to
                listen my idea, I decided to show them the problem. I read for
                them the assignment questions, like a check list. I started to
                ask were is each pint in our work. They identity the gap, and
                surprisengly on of them gave the same idea that I was talking
                before. I did'nt say anything, and offer myself to work on this
                part. Because the most important thing is to get the job done
                and we got the maximum score.
