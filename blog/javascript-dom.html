              >JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</span
            >
            <p></p>
            <p>
              Why web sites or applications must use HTML, CSS and Java Script?
              <br />
              A hypertext markup language, the meaning of HTML, used to format
              documents shared and searched on the web. With browsers and the
              internet popularization, HTML became more used to build websites
              and became the most popular language of the Web. During the
              technology evolution, hardware and software, web pages started to
              require better interfaces, so CSS and Javascript became the most
              popular combination to build their front-end.
            </p>

            <p>
              The relationship HTML, CSS and Javacript can be analogue to build
              a house. When HMTL has the necessary material to build the
              foundation of the house, with walls and ceilling. HTML has a clear
              and today universal structure with helps to understand which each
              tag does and is used for. CSS is the part which is not essential
              but neccessary to imput some other extra values to the house. This
              language can create a personal touch to the house and also achieve
              specific requirements to make this house more pleasant to use. We
              can think about colors, decoration objects and any other element
              in the house if they don't exist the house still a house.
              Javascript is the part which makes things work. A house can have a
              walls and ceilling for exmaple, but today every house must have
              eletricity, fresh water or sewage installation. To make this
              things work, it's neccessary some extra work combining html and
              css. To tunn on a lamp for example, it's necessary to define the
              lamp type, position but also connect the eletricity and make it
              work.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we compare HMTL, CSS and Javacript, the last one is more
              similar to program languages. Because of this it requires more
              time to learn and have more "power" than html and css. Javacript
              is also evolving more along the time then HTML and CSS. It's also
              used as the foundation to build another frameworks to build
              applications.
            </p>
            <br />
            <span class="question"
              >Control flow and loops, arrays, and objects</span
            >
            <p>
              Control flow, loops, arrays and objects are common thing to
              programm languages. To organize instructions to a computer program
              language has ways to define conditions to do or not to do a
              specifi step, like if - then - else, or switch case. Repeat the
              same instruction until a centain condition called loops, like
              while or for. Another important part of program laguages is to
              have strutures to manipulate and store data. The most common are
              arrays and objects. Arrays are much more simple structure often
              used to store and manipulate data in sequence. And Objects are
              more complex struture to organize a group of attibutes such as
              define wich elements an user data strucute should have.
            </p>
            <span class="question">Functions and why they are useful</span>
            <p>
              Functions again is a common thing to programm languages, they help
              to organize and the most important thing re-use a specific group
              of instructions. Instead having a long sequence of instructions,
              the developer can create different functions to build the
              application in a more efficient and organized way. Functions can
              receive parameters, data inputs wich might be manipulated inside
              the function body. And when the fuction instructions changes or
              create a new data, this should be returned when this function is
              called. Java Script also has evolving the way to write functions
              with something like arrow functions.
            </p>
            <br />
            <span class="question">The DOM and Dev Tools</span>
            <p>
              To build interactions with HMTL elements, a standard model is used
              called Document Object Model. This model organizes a html
              elements, and allows them to be manipulated and modified. 
              
              Browsers need read and understand these html documents to reflect their
              content to the device screen. 
              </p>
              <p>This model define a hierarchy and
              relationship between HTML elements which enables the developer to
              access them using a program language. Despite JavaScript is today
              the most popular language used for DOM manipulation, this model
              can be used for any other languages. Bellow is a DOM structure
              example
              <div class="blog-box">
                <img
                src="./images/dom.jpg"
                
                alt="dom picture"
              />
              </div>
              <p>To acces the DOM, Javacript uses an API, which offers many methods which can be readed here <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model" target="_blank"> DOM API</a>
              It's not necessary to install anything to use the DOM because they are part of the browsers. All elements can be added, removed and modified using Javascript.   </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                Basics DOM objects:
                <ul>
                  <li>Document - it's the root object and represents the html document</li>
                  <li>Node </li>
                  <li>Element</li>
                  <li>Attribute</li>
                  <li>Text</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                
              </p>
              
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
