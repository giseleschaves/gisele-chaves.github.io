              The learning plan describes how I will operate within the Dev Academy Foundations

            <h3>14 February 2024</h3>
            <span class="question">1 - What is your long term goal or career pathway?</span>
            <p>
              My long term goal is to work as a developer again. 
              I have been working in IT during a while, started as a developer but received an opportunity to became business analyst and project manager.
              During a while I had the impression that I would never come back to work with coding again.
              In 2022 I've decide to do two courses one about Prodcut Management and another Code Bootcamp and decided to turn my career into more tech.
              To entry at the New Zealand market, I decided to apply for testing jobs and got my first IT job in New Zealand.
              Recently I got my residence visa, but recently lost my job due my company lost many corntracts.

              I finally can apply for Dev Academy. It's a turbulent time for me but I hope that I can join the course.

              <span class="question"> 2 - A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</span>
              <ul class="answer-list">
                <li>Strenghs - Resilient and fast learning. </li>
                <li>Limitation - Anxiety and Insonmia </li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <span class="question">3 - What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</span>
              <ul class="answer-list">
                <li>non-tecnical core - I need to learn how to deal with anxiety. This is the main issue in my life. I'm doing therapy which helped me a lot and need to do more exercises</li>
                <li>human skills - I'm good to deal with people but after the pandemic I became more lazy to hang out</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <span class="question">4 - A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</span>
              <ul class="answer-list">
                <li>
                  An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Work Productively: Build a work routine and define clear and achievable tasks and goals </li>
              </p>
              <p>Work with others: Define a specific time and day to talk others having a clear idea what you want to achieve</li>
              </p>
              <ul class="answer-list">
                <li>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                I will listen my body and try to control my anxiety doing some exersices at the morning. Organize my sleeping routine and don't use my phone 1 hour before and after sleep.
                My main problem is not technical, it's how to take care of myself and auto-sabotage.
              </p>
              <br>
              <span class="question">5 - A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</span>
              <p>I often search on the internet for help, there is so much material and good explanations.
                When the problem is a bug or a not expected result in my code, I like to checl step by step using console log.
              </p>
              <span class="question">6 - A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</span>
              <p>
                My expectation comes from a previous code bootcamp experience. The facilitators plan weekly sessions to do the challenge of the week.
                We didn't build in group, but we just had this time to undestand better what to do and the facilitator helped each person if they get stuck.
                With this approch we complete the main challenges of the week during the session.

                Each person was free to do the challenges in their own time, but this approach helped a lot.
                During the week we could ask for more extra support, and go deep in the tech material. 
                It was my fault that I didn't understand dev academy approch for the foundation week.
              </p>
              <span class="question">7 - Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</span>
              <p>
                I don't have any schedulling problem at the moment, only my therapy session every Wednesday at 6am. ;-)
                I had some final work appointments during the fisrt week of the foundation but I'm all free now.
